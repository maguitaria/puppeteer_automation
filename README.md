# Puppeteer Web Scraping Script
My small project about checking menu of Foodoo student`s restaurant at Oulu  universite to get the downloaded menu and screenshot.

This is a Node.js script that uses Puppeteer, a headless browser automation tool, to scrape a webpage, capture a snapshot, take a screenshot, and extract text content from a specified webpage. It also includes a step to interact with the webpage by clicking on a specific element.

## Prerequisites

Before running this script, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js: You can download it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).
- npm (Node Package Manager): npm usually comes with Node.js.

Additionally, you will need to install the Puppeteer package:

```bash
npm install puppeteer
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or create a new Node.js project.

2. Create a new JavaScript file (e.g., `scrape.js`) and copy the script into this file.

3. Replace the URL in the script with the webpage you want to scrape:

   ```javascript
   await page.goto("https://fi.jamix.cloud/apps/menu/?anro=93077&k=48&mt=89");
   ```

4. Run the script using Node.js:

   ```bash
   node scrape.js
   ```

The script will perform the following actions:

1. Launch a headless browser.
2. Navigate to the specified webpage.
3. Click on an element containing the text "English" using `page.evaluate`.
4. Capture a snapshot of the webpage in MHTML format and save it as `page.mhtml`.
5. Take a screenshot of the webpage and save it as `screenshot.png`.
6. Extract the text content of the webpage and save it as `foodoo_menu.txt`.
7. Close the browser.

You can customize the script for your specific use case or further process the captured data as needed.
## Future enhancements
- Add  CSS locator for English menu and send it to email.
- Go to each meal calories estimation and estimate what is the healthiest option.
- Any suggestions?
